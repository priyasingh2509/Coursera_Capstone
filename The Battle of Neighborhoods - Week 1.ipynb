When finalizing a neighborhood to hunt for an apartment, security is considered a major issue when moving to a new location. If you are not safe in your own home, you cannot live there. Crime statistics provide insight into this issue.\n\nWe focus on Safe Borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that you can choose the best neighborhood that suits a person's needs."
